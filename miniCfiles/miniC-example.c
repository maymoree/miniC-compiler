/* This file gives you an example program in miniC language.
* We focus on compiling a program in a single file using the following format:
* A program in miniC contains only a single function definition. You can name this
function anything other
* than main, print, or read. It has two extern function declarations
* for print and read that we will use to print and read values without
* explicitly calling printf and scanf. The extern declarations of these functions
are always
*in the order given below.
* I have included comments with individual lines of code
* to help you understand the structure of code in more detail.
*/

extern int read(); // function to read a value
/* In miniC we only use interger types.
* All local variables and parameters are integers.
* Return value of the function is also an integer.
